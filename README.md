The purpose of this project is to develop software for my Z80 homebrew computer.

I chose the Z80 for its simplicity in design, simplicity in asssebly language, active development community and low cost.
The goal is to eventually develop this collection of software into a Real Time Operating System (RTOS) 


I'm encouraging anyone interested to help, here are somne ideas that I currently have for the project:
  
    -Single board Computer
  
    -Retro Desktop
  
    -Handheld device, like a calculator or something
  
    -Or really anything neet/useful

I'm not a developer, I'm just a hobbist. So my code likely is not prefect, feel free to point out any flaws or suggest other ways to code better.

Thank you!\n
